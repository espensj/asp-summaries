# Short summaries of African Storybook stories

This repository contains summaries of all the stories from [African Storybook](http://my.africanstorybook.org) in the form of short descriptions in each language. The original text of the stories can be found in the [asp-source](https://github.com/global-asp/asp-source) repository.

## Purpose

## Organization

The summaries are organized into different folders by ISO language code. A full list of the available language codes can be found [here](https://github.com/global-asp/asp-source#languages).

Each story has an ID number corresponding to the code used in the [asp-source](https://github.com/global-asp/asp-source) repository.
